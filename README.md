# Startup Script for Ollama + Open WebUI

This is a startup script to launch an instance of Ollama and Open WebUI in a single command.

I've included a PGP signature of the script file.

## How it Works

1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Start Ollama
3. Start Open WebUI in a Docker Container
4. Open the localhost URL in a browser
